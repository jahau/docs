# Nebula comparision to other orchestration platforms

A common question is why need another orchestrator when there are many other popular options? 

The answer for that is that while the popular container orchestrators are great they have a few limitations which Nebula avoids:

 1. Scale - even though this issue keep improving with all orchestrators Nebula approach allows for far greater scalability (alongside Mesos)
 2. Multi region clusters - orchestrators tend to be latency sensitive, Nebula unique architecture makes it ideal to managing distributed apps (like CDN or IOT), while still maintaining agility
 3. Managing clients appliances\IoT devices - this option is not covered by any of the current orchestrators as it's outside their use case scope
 4. Config management - while Puppet\Chef\Ansible are great for config management and orchestrators are great for scaling containers Nebula can also be thought of as a docker config management system
 
Attached below is a table comparision between Nebula and the popular options, info in it is correct to the time of writing.

    The tables slides to to side for viewing it's full information (not clear do to the rtfd theme)

|  | Nebula | Mesos+Marathon\DC/OS | Kubernetes | Swarm | balena.io |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Optimal use case  | Distributed systems orchestration and\or IoT deployments orchestration | DataCenter orchestration | DataCenter orchestration | DataCenter orchestration | IoT deployments orchestration |
| Stateless masters | yes | yes | yes | no - data stored in local master raft consensus  | unknown |
| Worker nodes Scale limit | tens of thousands  | tens of thousands | 1000-5000 depending on version | unknown | unknown |
| Containers Scale limit | millions | millions | 120000 | unknown | unknown |
| Health-check limits | unlimited - uses docker builtin health checks | depending on check type - https://mesosphere.com/blog/2017/01/05/introducing-mesos-native-health-checks-apache-mesos-part-1/ | unknown | unlimited - uses docker builtin health checks | unknown |
| Multi region\DC workers | yes | possible but not recommended according to latest DC/OS docs | possible via multiple clusters controlled via an ubernetes cluster | yes | unknown |
| Multi region\DC masters | yes - each master is only contacted when an API call is made | possible but extremely not recommended according to latest DC/OS docs | not possible - even with ubernetes each region masters only manage it's own regions | possible but not recommended do to raft consensus  | unknown |
| Designed for huge scales | yes | yes | if you consider 1000-5000 instances huge | unknown | unknown |
| Full REST API | yes | yes | yes | partial - by default no outside endpoint is available  | yes |
| Self healing | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Simple worker scaling up & down | yes | yes | yes | partial - scaling down cleanly requires an api call rather then just shutting down the server like the rest | semi - requires flushing a custom OS onto the device |
| cron job management support | yes | yes | yes | no | no |
| CLI | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| GUI | WIP | yes | yes | no | on managed service version |
| Load Balancing | yes- supports bringing your own HAProxy\Nginx\etc in a 2 step process (the first between instances & the 2nd between containers on that instance) | yes - HTTP only for outside connections - marathon-lb, supports bringing your own otherwise | yes | yes - auto routes inside the cluster but you still need to LB between cluster nodes from the outside  | no - IoT devices only |
| Simple masters scaling up & down | yes - master is fully stateless | no | no | partial - simple as long as quorum remains in the process | unknown |
| Simple containers scaling up & down | yes - single api call and\or adding\removing worker nodes | yes - single api call | yes - single api call | yes - single api call | unknown |
| Modular design (or plugin support) | yes - every part does 1 thing only | yes - 2 step orchestrator | yes | yes | unknown |
| Backend DB's | MongoDB | Zookeeper | EtcD | internal in masters | Postgres & Redis & S3|
| Multiple apps share worker node | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Distributed apps support | yes    |  no   |  no   |  no   | yes |
| Dynamic allocation of work containers | no | yes | yes | yes | no |
| Changes processing time scalability | extremely short, each worker is unaffected from the rest | longish - must wait for an offer matching it requirements first which at complex clusters can take a bit | short - listens to EtcD for changes which is fast but the masters don't scale when the load does | longish - gossip protocol will get there in the end but might take the scenic route | unknown |
| Type of containers supported | docker with possible future extension | docker, mesos universal container | docker with possible future extension | docker only | docker only - requires a custom OS on devices |
| Key trade-offs | allows scales of Mesos with full health checks with very rapid deployments\changes while being unlimited to a single region\DC while being stable at the cost of changing apps per node require an envvar change & having lots of moving parts | battle proven orchestrator that's damn near impossible to break at the cost of speed of changes & sticking to a single zone (for clusters with requests counts smaller then a million in a single region this is an amazing solution) | the buzzword choice, very popular (so support & updates are great) but kinda forces you to do things the Google way & not nearly as scalable as some other choices | comes prebuilt with the docker engine so easy to set up but is kinda of a black box, also using GOSSIP only ensures eventual consistency so who knows when a requested change takes affect | designed for IoT so it shares a similar set of trade-offs to Nebula |
| Recommended deployment method | run a docker container of it | complex and varies depending on your design | complex and varies depending on your design | prebuilt in docker engine so just a couple of commands | run the managed service of it |
| Usual pricing strategy | FOSS - pay for infra only | FOSS - pay for infra only | managed - pay for infra + masters overhead management | FOSS - pay for infra only | managed - pay per device |
